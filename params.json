  "body": "### Welcome to the CT-based pCT generation project.\r\nThis project contains a part of the code useful to reproduce the image processing pipeline proposed in the article by Maspero M. et al ("Quantification of confounding factors in MRI-based dose calculations as applied to prostate IMRT") to Physics in Medicine and Biology. The article presents an approach to disentangle confounding factors that may occur in comparison study for accuracy evaluation of Magnetic Resonance (MR)-only based dose calculation.  \r\n\r\n### Study Design\r\nWe proposed a strategy to circumvent inter-scan differences between Computer Tomography (CT) and MR imaging session by generating CT-based pseudo-CT (pCT) that mimic the output of the pCT generation technique used in our clinic.\r\n\r\n### Which code can you find here?\r\nA simplified version of the code used to generate MR- and CT based pCT. The code here presented illustrates how to:\r\n1. access to dicom data;\r\n2. automatically delineate the CT body contour;\r\n3. generate water-equivalent bulk-assigned pCT;\r\n4. generate pCT that mimic the bulk-assignment proposed by the MR-based pCT generation method used in the article;\r\n5. properly generate pCT that can be pushed to a database, maintaining the relation with the original data.\r\n  \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMaspero Matteo (@matteomaspero) et al. This code has been used in "Quantification of confounding factors in MRI-based dose calculations as applied to prostate IMRT" as described in the article published in to Phyiscs in Medicine and Biology (2016). \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nDo you have any question about the methods, or are you having trouble with the page? Please contact the owner of the repository & thank you very much in advance for any comments.\r\n",
